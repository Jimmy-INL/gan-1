**WARNING: deprecated code (Please see DA-PredGAN)** 

- 1.Compression.ipynb -> Compress the 800 variables per time step to 15 variables per time step (The compression I am using is from PCA. However, there are in this file other types of compression using autoencoders). 

- 2.GAN-training.ipynb -> Train a GAN and save the model 

- 3.GAN-Prediction.ipynb -> Predict with the GAN
